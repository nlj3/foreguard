# Changelog

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) from 1.0.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Effect-rich Mutation Plan** — the preview now describes the *concrete effect* of
  each mutation, extracted from its arguments: `deletes <path>`, `METHOD <url>`,
  `writes N bytes to <path>` (with a content snippet), `SQL: <stmt>`, `runs: <cmd>`,
  `sends to <recipient>`, with a compact-args fallback. Shown in both the `plan`
  output and the proxy's intercept log.
- **Transparent MCP dry-run proxy** (`foreguard proxy -- <server…>`) — launches an
  MCP tool server and proxies stdio JSON-RPC to/from the host, forwarding
  everything **except** mutating `tools/call`s, which are intercepted and answered
  with a synthetic dry-run success (nothing executes). Point Claude Code / Cursor /
  Cline at it instead of the server — no agent changes. Two-task architecture
  drains in-flight responses cleanly on shutdown.
- **Argument-aware classification** — the preview now inspects a tool's
  *arguments*, not just its name, and **upgrades** the verdict when they reveal a
  hidden mutation (fail-safe: arguments can only make a call more restricted).
  Catches the cases a name-only classifier misses:
  - a read-looking `fetch`/`request` with a writing HTTP `method` (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE),
  - a `query`/`sql` whose leading keyword mutates (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DROP/…),
  - an `operation`/`action` argument that names a mutating action,
  - a destructive program or write-redirect in a `command`/`cmd`/`script`.

  The Mutation Plan now shows *why* an argument-detected mutation was flagged.

### Changed

- Depend on the published `kedge-core = "0.2"` (hardened, deny-wins) instead of a
  git revision.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-24

### Added

- Initial release: `foreguard plan` produces a **Mutation Plan** from a JSON list
  of tool calls — classifying each as read-only (would run) or mutating
  (intercepted, previewed, not executed), with `--json` output.
- Classification engine reused from [kedge](https://github.com/nlj3/kedge)
  (`kedge-core`) — fail-safe and deny-wins.
- Pro hygiene: CI (fmt/clippy/test/audit on Linux + macOS), dependabot, pinned
  toolchain, BUSL-1.1 license.
