## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial scaffold: `foreguard plan` produces a **Mutation Plan** from a JSON list
  of tool calls — classifying each as read-only (would run) or mutating
  (intercepted, previewed, not executed), with `--json` output.
- Classification engine reused from [kedge](https://github.com/nlj3/kedge)
  (`kedge-core`) as a git dependency — fail-safe and deny-wins.
- Pro hygiene: CI (fmt/clippy/test/audit on Linux + macOS), dependabot, pinned
  toolchain, BUSL-1.1 license.
